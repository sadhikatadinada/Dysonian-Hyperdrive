                      <h1>Flare, Space Mining</h1>
                      <p>Spacecraft would have to carry food and supplies 
                        for the mining crew and the equipment for the mine. 
                        Newly developed spacecraft should make landing on an asteroid possible. 
                        After all, we have already landed on the moon, and some asteroids pass 
                        by closer than the moon. A spacecraft going to an asteroid would need 
                        less rocket power and fuel than one going to the moon.
                        With the help of HoP, spacecraft would be able to teleport to areas 
                        which are abundant with asteroids, like the asteroid belt between the 
                        orbits of Mars and Jupiter, the kuiper belt etc.</p>
